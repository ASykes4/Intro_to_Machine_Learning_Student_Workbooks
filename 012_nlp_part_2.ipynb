There is up to one feature per different word in our text sample, as well as more for multi-word combinations if there are larger ngrams allowed, far larger than a typical feature set that we're used to. One thing we can do when vectorizing is just to cap the number of features we end up with, but that doesn't seem to be the most sophisticated or smartest approach. \n",

    "Using LSA is a good way to condense our feature set that is often extremely large and extremely sparse, especially when we are dealing a large dataset, as is common with NLP. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simple applications in which this technique is used are documented clustering in text analysis, recommender systems, and information retrieval. More detailed use-cases of topic modeling are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> <b>Resume Summarization:</b> It can help recruiters to evaluate resumes by a quick glance. They can reduce effort in filtering pile of resume.\n",
    "<li> <b>Search Engine Optimization:</b> online articles, blogs, and documents can be tag easily by identifying the topics and associated keywords, which can improve optimize search results.\n",
    "<li> <b>Recommender System Optimization:</b> recommender systems act as an information filter and advisor according to the user profile and previous history. It can help us to discover unvisited relevant content based on past visits.\n",
    "<li> <b>Improving Customer Support:</b> Discovering relevant topics and associated keywords in customer complaints and feedback for examples product and service specifications, department, and branch details. Such information help company to directly rotated the complaint in respective department.\n",

    "In general, non-neural network approaches to NLP tend to be present in areas where we need to be able to process text quickly, without lots of processing. Spam filters are the classic example - we need to say yes or no, without spending ages to do so or burdening an email service with lots of processing. The examples above are similar - we are trying to draw a simple-ish conclusion. This is also somewhere that our old friend Bayes and his classifiers are most commonly seen - they are very fast at generating predictions once trained, so for something like emails, that's likely to be a good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important concept from this example is the idea of condesing multiple features down into a smaller feature set while attempting to maintain the information in the original, that is something we'll revisit with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a similar technique that is more generally applicable, later on."

We will use word2vec for a couple of different things:\n",

The word2vec model will replace the count/tf-idf scores that we previously used for our feature set with embeddings that it calculates as the w2v model trains. The w2v model is \"learning\" how to represent words with numbers, in this case dimensions in a multidimensional space.\n",

    "## Using Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that Word2Vec allows us to do is to look at the similarity of words. This similarity is calculated via the cosine distance of the vectors. Cosine similarity is a technique to calculate the distance between two vectors - smaller distance, more similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Cosine Similarity](images/cosine_sim.png \"Cosine Similarity\" )\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the vectors are derived by in the training process, these similarity calculations are pretty easy and quick. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> the similarites here are calculated by the values derived from our trained model. So they are based on the relationships in our text. Word2Vec and other NLP packages also commonly have pretrained models that can be downloaded that are based on large amounts of text. Words may be represented very differently in those vs whatever we train here - the more data we have, the more consistent they'll be; the more \"unique\" our text is, the more different it will be. If we were, for example, working in a specific domain such as patent law, we could use a large amount of patent law text to train a model that would be more consistent with our domain. Or, perhaps more likely, we could use a pretrained model that has been created with massive amounts of training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the similarity of different words, we can measure that similarity in a couple of ways - lexical and semantic, that we mentioned before. Here, the model is looking at semantic similarity, the \"meaning\" of each word, in the context of our text, is being compared and the most similar words are returned. Note that we can only calculate similarity here for words that we have in our vocabulary. This is one place where large language models like chat GPT have a massive advantage, their vocabulary is huge. "

    "We can take our actual data now and transform it through the Word2Vec model that we've made. This will generate our smaller feature set that we can build our models from, one of the things that the MeanEmbeddingVectorizer does is to collapse the data down to those 200 dimensions in the vector. Our dataset is spit out the other end, each row of text is now represented by a single vector of those 200 dimensions of our embedding values from the word2vec model (the columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> if this is confusing, please ignore it, this is a bit of a tangent. The meanembeddingvectorizer thing is needed to \"flatten\" our data down from 200D to 1D for each token. This is because our models can only dal with data that is in that format (instances x features). We can't have a 200D vector for each token, we need to collapse it down to a single value. Later, when we look at neural networks, we'll see models with differnet architectures that can accomadate data that is multidimensional like this. That's one of the reasons that neural networks are so powerful, they can accomadate data that is multidimensional, so something like an image can be treated like an image, not just a bunch of pixels."

    "## Pretrained Word2Vec Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When we do the intial training of the word2vec model (not when we are making final predictions), we are using our corpus to generate the space and the embeddigns for all of our tokens. We can also download a pretrained model, that already has the N-dimensional space defined (when it was trained on some different data), and use that to generate our embeddings. This is a common practice, and can be a good way to get started. Gensim has several models that have been trained on varying amounts of data, they are listed here: https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim-data along with several other datasets that we could use to train a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The differences with using this pretrained model (or an existing corpus below) are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Above, when training word2vec with our data, we used our corpus to generate the space in which the tokens are placed, then calculate those embeddings for each token. \n",
    "<li> With a pretrained model, we are using the space that was generated by the model that was trained on some other data, then placing our tokens in that space. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we are using some text from wikipedia (like the second example), the space in which embeddings are made is defined by the text in wikipedia. So the \"closeness\" in meaning of words is based on what is in that corpus. We then take our tokens and calculate their embeddings in that space. The big advantage to this is someone else can train a model on lots of data, which hopefully generates a better understanding of the relationships between words, and we can then just score our words on those scales. This approach is common in large models, like text processing or image recognition, where the training load can be too large for \"regular folk\". We can also take these trained models and \"customize\" them to our data, we'll look at that with image recognition at the end of the semester. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use a Twitter Trained Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We can try using a pretrained model that was trained on Twitter data. This model has been pretrained, so it already knows how to represent words, we will then feed it all of our tokens, and it will generate the embeddings for us."

    "As we see with things like chatGPT and the assortment of voice assistants, NLP is currently exploding in both capability and prevelence. Those other models are based on these concepts, but there are a few key differences that help those tools be more powerful:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> They are trained on much larger datasets. Very, very, very large datasets. In NLP specifically, this helps because it can help address the problem with us having so many words, many of which aren't used super often - i.e. the fact that there are a lot of words that don't occur together in the same sentence. If the training data is massive (e.g. \"the internet\"), we massively reduce the impact of this problem, as we see each word many times. \n",
    "<li> The use of neural networks, in particular recurrant neural networks (RNNs) that are able to deal with data as a sequence, and \"remember\" other parts of a sequence of words. This helps these models understand the context of a sentence, and the relationships between words.\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Of note with neural networks, especially those using massive training data sets, is that the first layers of the model can perform equivalent data prep work that we've done here. So the model is more able to deal with data in its raw form, and doesn't need to be preprocessed as much separately, in advance. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Manual intervention is used, humans provide examples of convesation, define labels, and evaluate the quality of the model's work. You may have heard news of Kenyans being paid low wages to label data for these models.\n",
    "<li> Other model types are used to help, such as reinforcement learning. Responses that are good are rewarded, and those that are bad are punished. This helps the model learn what is good and what is bad. This is particularly useful for generative models, such as chatGPT.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted, this stuff is actively being developed right now, and the more advanced the tool, the more likely we are to see innovation or specific interventions to correct issues. The foundations we have looked at here are the building blocks of that work. "
